# Vector-Clocks-for-Distributed-Systems
Implemented Vector Clocks used commonly across Distributed Systems

# Project Description:
This program computes vector clocks of events that occur in financial
transactions.  
Three processes (1, 2, and 3) all start with balance = $1,000. At each process, one of the three events, namely Withdraw, Deposit, and Send money to another process, happens once every five seconds chosen randomly.  
The amount of all the transactions must be less than $100.  
The vector clocks are displayed for each event.
